# File embedder
Usage is `embedfiles [file to embed...] [-l {c}] [-o {outfile}]`. To specify another language use the `-l` option (C is the only  lang supported as of now). It creates a new file in the specified language and puts a byte array of the inputfile in. Example output: 
<details>
  <summary>Example Output</summary>
  in.txt: 
  
  ```
  Hello World!
  ```
  
  out.c: 
  
  ```
  #include <stdlib.h>
  const char in.txt[] = {
    0x48, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f, 0x20, 0x57, 0x6f, 0x72, 0x6c, 
    0x64, 0x21, 0x0a, 
  };
  const size_t in.txt_len = sizeof(in.txt);
  ```
